# Image-Steganography-using-LSB-Encoding-and-Decoding
C-based image steganography application that hides and extracts secret messages using LSB techniques.

This project implements Image Steganography in C using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within image files. The application allows users to embed text data into an image without causing noticeable visual changes and later extract the hidden information accurately.

The project demonstrates low-level programming concepts such as bit manipulation, binary file handling, memory management, and data encoding/decoding techniques.

## Features

* Hide secret messages inside image files using LSB encoding
* Extract hidden messages using LSB decoding
* Preserve image quality after data embedding
* Efficient binary file processing
* Secure message recovery without data loss
* Command-line based implementation in C

## Technologies Used

* C Programming
* Bit Manipulation
* Binary File I/O
* File Handling
* Data Encoding and Decoding

## How It Works

### Encoding

* Reads the source image and secret message.
* Stores message bits in the least significant bits of image pixel data.
* Generates a new image containing the hidden message.

### Decoding

* Reads the encoded image.
* Extracts the least significant bits from image data.
* Reconstructs and displays the original hidden message.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understanding of steganography concepts
* Practical use of bitwise operators
* Binary file manipulation in C
* Data encoding and decoding techniques
* Low-level memory and file operations

## Future Enhancements

* Password-protected message extraction
* Support for larger file formats
* Encryption before embedding
* GUI-based interface
* Support for hiding multiple files
